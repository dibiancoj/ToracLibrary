make sure the startup project is not core. Otherwise you won't be able to update

Update-database -startupproject "ToracLibrary.UnitTest" -verbose


*** make sure to run -startupproject "ToracLibrary.UnitTest" with everything otherwise you will get errors because its looking for the connection string in ToracLibrary.Core
(NewTable is the migration name)
ie: add-migration NewTable -startupproject "ToracLibrary.UnitTest" -verbose
