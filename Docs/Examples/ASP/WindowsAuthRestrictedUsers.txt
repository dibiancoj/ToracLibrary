1. Make sure IIS has the following:
	A. anonymous access is turned off (you wont be able to restrict based on user if you leave this on)
	B  turn windows auth on

Even though its it the web config it needs to match in IIS.


In the web.config
<authentication mode="Windows"/>
    <authorization>
       <allow users="MyDomain\UserName1"/> 
	   <allow users="MyDomain\UserName2"/> 
       <deny users="*" />
       <deny users="?"/>
    </authorization>
