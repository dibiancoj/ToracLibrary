If you have a scenario where you need to flip between MyAppDebug.config and MyAppProd.config


In solution, right click, properties

in the post build: 
copy "$(ProjectDir)\\test$(ConfigurationName).txt" "$(ProjectDir)\\testNew.txt"

Use the macro button to view other variables you could use

When the testNew.txt is there...include it in project.

Then when you go to publish whichever the env is. (either debug or release) that config will be there
