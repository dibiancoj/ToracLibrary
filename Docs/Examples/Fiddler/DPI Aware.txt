With retina displays you get cut off text, menu bar is cut off.

To fix:

C:\Users\dibiancj\AppData\Local\Programs\Fiddler\Fiddler.exe -dpiAware

..essentially just change fiddler to run with the -dpiAware command


4/11/2018 - it looks like Telerik fixed this issue with a new release. I don't believe you need this anymore.
