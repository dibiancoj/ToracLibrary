COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN, NCHAR(65279) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN, '')

declare @tbl table
(
	bla nvarchar(max)
)

insert into @tbl(bla) values (N'Have you had bloating of the abdomen (belly﻿)﻿?')

update @tbl set bla = cast(REPLACE(bla + NCHAR(65279) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN, NCHAR(65279) COLLATE Latin1_General_BIN, '') as varchar(200))
