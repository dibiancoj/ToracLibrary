**** Have multiple configs. ie: dev vs production (if you need it bc config is completely different                              ****
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Really just create another file ie: webpack.config.prod.js

Put the same exact settings for web pack...change whatever you need.

Then to run "webpack --config webpack.config.prod.js".


Note: you can also do this with a vendor configuration. So the vendor stuff will be in the vendor. If you don't have alot of stuff try to do it in 1 file. Just cleaner and you don't have to remember to update vendor if you make a change
