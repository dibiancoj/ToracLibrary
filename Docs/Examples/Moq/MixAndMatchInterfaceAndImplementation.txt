  the key is .As<IValidicService>()
  var mockValidicSvc = new Mock<ValidicService>(logger, mockPortalApi.Object, mockHttpPortalSvcPassThrough.Object).As<IValidicService>();

  //then call base = true so it runs the implementation
  mockValidicSvc.CallBase = true;

  //then setup anything you want to moq

  This will run some methods as the regular method...and some as mocked.


  (haven't test but i believe it works)
  Shorthand = new Mock<ExcelEPPlusCreator>() { CallBase = true }.As<IExcelEPPlusCreator>();
