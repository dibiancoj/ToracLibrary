gulp.task('watchTask', function () {
    gulp.watch("./wwwroot/js/**/*.js", ['js']); <-- array with 'js' is the gulp tasks to run when something changed
});


or 
gulp.task('default', ....


1. This just start the watch task while developing  in the task runner explorer
2. add /// <binding ProjectOpened='default' /> on the top of the gulp file or in the task runner bind to on solution start (the binding creates the /// <bindin... tag at the top of the file). This way when the solution opens it starts the watcher
