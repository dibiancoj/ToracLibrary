----------- basic way to do this -----------

//import bootstrap so the border-radius mixin is happy
@import "../../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";

//pull in this mix-in which is what we want
@import "../../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins/border-radius";

.nav-item {

    > a:hover {
        background-color: $themeColor-Dark;
		
		//add this mix which will make this item "round" which is pulled in from the bootstrap sass
        @include border-radius;
    }
}


----------- example of gutters -----------

@import "../../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/_variables";

.validation-summary-errors {
    /*this is from the bootstrap variable. This is the total of left and right that is why we divide by 2*/
    padding-left: $grid-gutter-width / 2;
}
