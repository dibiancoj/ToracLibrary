If I have 

public class MyClass
{
  public string Text{get;set;}
}

In a razor view i can do 
@Html.DisplayFor(x => x.EditModel.MyClassInstance)

Then it see's that MyClassInstance is of type MyClass and renders
MyClass.cshtml <-- model in this view should be MyClass


...Essentially a default view for a class.
