Vue.nextTick(function () {

                // DOM has updated..go trigger the resize now

                $(window).trigger('resize');

            })                 


Go run this method after the ui completes.
Just add this anywhere in your code

I basically had something where i needed to repaint the screen after i set a variable so 
I had the following:

this.SetVariable = true; //this triggers a UI updated

Vue.nextTick(function(){
 //DOM has updated..go trigger the resize now
 $(window).trigger('resize');
});
